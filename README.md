# Customer-Lifetime-Value-CLV-Prediction-and-Visualization-Using-Machine-Learning

# Overview

This project focuses on predicting the Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) using historical transaction data from an online retail store. It uses machine learning regression models to predict the future value of customers and provides insightful business visualizations for analysis.

# Dataset

# Key Business Metrics

Recency: Days since the customer's last purchase.

Frequency: Number of unique invoices (purchases).

Monetary: Total spending (CLV).

Country: Customer location.

#Technologies Used

# Key Learnings
How to clean and transform raw transaction data for ML modeling.

Understand RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) metrics.

Build interpretable models to predict CLV.

Visualize actionable customer insights for business strategy.

# Future Work
Deploy as a web app (Flask / Streamlit)
